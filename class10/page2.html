  <p>This is some text with <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, and <u>underline</u> formatting. It goes on for a while, not really saying much of interest, but then, all of a sudden, it breaks<br>
  in the middle of a line and continues on until<br>
  it breaks in the middle of another line and then rambles on some more until it has continued in this vein for quite some time. It picks up with another sentence to emphasize that this is a paragraph, not just a particularly long run-on sentence.
  <!-- This is a comment. It doesn't show up in the output -->
  <p>This is another paragraph. This one might be useful for showing some escaping of text. How do you say 2 &lt; 3? You can't just use a left angle bracket, because that would be the start of a tag. Instead, you have to write "&amp;lt;" which the browser will turn into a left angle bracket.</p>
  <p>Now it's time for some lists. Firs there is an <i>ordered</i> list. Its elements are numbered. </p>
  <ol>
    <li>This is the first item.</li>
    <li>This is the second item.</li>
    <li>This is the third item.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Now for an <i>unordered</i> list. Its elements are bulleted.
  <ul>
    <li>This is the first item.</li>
    <li>This is the second item. It has a sublist!
    <ol>
      <li>This is the first subitem.</li>
      <li>This is the second subitem.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>This is the third item.</li>
  </ul>
